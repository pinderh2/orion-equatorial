# orion-equatorial

This is a simple Arduino sketch used with the equatorial mount I built for
my Orion XT-10 telescope.
Please see [this page](https://howardpinder.com/home/telescope-mount-design/) for a description
of the project.

## Getting Started

Just install the Arduino software, install two libraries (see code for details) and
then build and download.

This software is intended for Arduino Uno, although it should work fine on a range of models.
